## About

Welcome to Advent of Code 2023! This repository contains solutions and discussions for the daily coding challenges from December 1st to December 25th.

Advent of Code is an annual programming competition created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). It features diverse challenges that test your coding skills and creativity. The challenges are released daily, and participants have 24 hours to solve them in any programming language.
